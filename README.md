#### About Us

We are Minions, a group of four students from NSU (North South University). Our project, Bangladeshi Healthy Food Prediction Model, is part of our CSE445 course project. We are passionate about promoting health and well-being through proper nutrition. For our project, we created a dataset completely from scratch. We collected Bangladeshi recipes from restaurants, home cooks, and blogs. To ensure the accuracy of our features, we surveyed 50 students from NSU, many of whom are from the pharmacy department. Additionally, we consulted with doctors to validate our findings. Our goal is to provide a reliable tool that can predict the healthiness of a recipe. We understand that not all ingredients are equally important for health, so we focus on the key ingredients that matter the most. To achieve accurate predictions, we utilized ensemble learning models. Thank you for using our Bangladeshi Healthy Food Predictor. We hope it helps you make informed decisions about your diet and leads you towards a healthier lifestyle.
